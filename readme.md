### What I Learned

In this project, I reinforced and practiced the following concepts:

During the creation of this Pokémon carousel, I learned and practiced how to:

* **Organize information:** How to place all HTML content in the right spot and structure it correctly.

* **Style everything:** How to use CSS to apply styles, colors, sizes, and align elements, ensuring the carousel looks good and is visually appealing.
* **Make things interactive:** How to use JavaScript to implement carousel navigation, making sure that when clicking the arrow buttons, the corresponding Pokémon card appears and others hide. I reinforced the use of events and DOM manipulation.
* **Adapt for mobile:** How to make the carousel layout adjust and function well on mobile phones and tablets (responsive design), in addition to computers, using media queries.
* **Work in parts:** I divided the project into small pieces, adding one part at a time (basic HTML, initial CSS, JS navigation, additional styles, responsiveness, etc.), which was great for me to work with multiple code versions in case I made a mistake. It's also very useful for maintaining focus!

### Next Steps

I want to continue improving my skills in:

* **More organized code:** Finding ways to make the code even easier to understand, maintain, and scale in the future, exploring patterns and best practices.

* **Making it accessible to everyone:** Ensuring the carousel can be used by people with different needs, such as those who use screen readers, by delving deeper into WAI-ARIA.
* **Testing for no errors:** Learning to create automated tests to ensure everything works as expected, guaranteeing project robustness.
* **Creating even better designs:** Understanding more about how to create screens that are both beautiful and easy to use (UX/UI design).

This course is sensational, it's helping me a lot as a beginner in programming. I recommend that you seek out the brothers to learn programming from scratch.
